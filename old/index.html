        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hey there!<br>
            My name is Jeremy Facchetti, I'm currently studying distributed cloud systems in LTU, Sweden. It is my first year here in Sweden, before coming here I was an exchange student at Oregon State University (my home university was Univeristy of Poitiers, France), for the last year of my bachelor in computer science. I mainly do oop, with a preference to C++ and Java, but I also like to do some python scripts and some bash sometimes.
